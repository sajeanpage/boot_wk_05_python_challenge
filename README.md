# Python Challenge

### PyBank

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze financial records. 
I was given a financial dataset called [budget_data.csv](/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv) composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

I was asked to analyze the records to calculate:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    
The result: [Analysis.txt](/PyBank/Analysis/Analysis.txt)

### PyPoll

In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

I was asked to analyze the votes to calculate:
  - The total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - The percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The total number of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote
    
The result: [Analysis.txt](/PyPoll/Analysis/Analysis.txt)
