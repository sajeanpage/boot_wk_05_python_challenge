# Python Challenge

### PyBank

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records. 
I was given a financial dataset called [budget_data.csv](/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv) composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

I was asked to analyze the records to calculate:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    
The result:
