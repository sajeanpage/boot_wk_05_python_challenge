# Python Challenge

### PyBank

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records. 
I was given a financial dataset called [budget_data.csv](/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv) composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

I was asked to analyze the records to calculate:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    
The code:
'''
# module imports
import os
import csv
import sys

# variables 
total_months = 0
net_total = 0
pl_change_tot = 0.00

# initialaizations
csvpath = os.path.join('Resources', 'budget_data.csv')

with open(csvpath) as csvfile:

    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',') # CSV reader 
    print(csvreader)

    csv_header = next(csvreader) # skip header row
    print(f"CSV Header: {csv_header}\n")

    # main loop
    for row in csvreader:
        pl = float(row[1])
        net_total = net_total + pl
        total_months = total_months + 1

        # no change month 1
        if total_months > 1: 
            pl_change = pl - pl_last
            pl_change_tot = pl_change_tot + pl_change

            # greatest incr and decr on month 2
            if total_months == 2:
                great_inc = pl_change
                great_inc_month = row[0]
                great_dec = pl_change
                great_dec_month = row[0]
            else:
                if pl_change > 0 and pl_change > great_inc:
                    great_inc = pl_change
                    great_inc_month = row[0]

                if pl_change < 0 and pl_change < great_dec:
                    great_dec = pl_change
                    great_dec_month = row[0]

        pl_last = pl

txtpath = os.path.join('Analysis', 'Analysis.txt')

# reference to the original standard output
original_stdout = sys.stdout 

# print to file
with open(txtpath, "w") as txtfile:
    sys.stdout = txtfile # Change the standard output to the file we created.
    print("Financial Analysis")
    print("----------------------------")
    print(f"Total Months: {total_months}")       
    print(f"Total: ${int(net_total)}")       
    print(f"Average Change: ${pl_change_tot / (total_months - 1):,.2f}")       
    print(f"Greatest Increase in Profits: {great_inc_month} (${int(great_inc)})")  
    print(f"Greatest Decrease in Profits: {great_dec_month} (${int(great_dec)})")
    sys.stdout = original_stdout 

# print to terminal
with open(txtpath, "r") as txtfile:
    txtfilecontent = txtfile.read()
    print(txtfilecontent)
